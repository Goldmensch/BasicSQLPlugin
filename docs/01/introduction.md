# Introduction / What can I expect.

Databases are often crucial when it comes to storing data.\
This tutorial aims to get you ready to store your data in your MariaDB or MySQL database.

We will start with some general preconditions we need to clarify and make some preparations.\
After this we will look into the DataSource and build our first connection to our database.\
To continue with reading and writing data to the database we will need to introduce some best practices. This will make
it easier for you to work with your database.\
After this we can finally come to write and read some data and will do this at the example of a pretty simple coins
plugin, which gives and takes coins.

After reading this guide you will have basic knowledge how to develop an application with a stable and good database
implementation.

Databases are a really large topic. We can't cover everything here. You might think this is much, but we are just
scraping the surface.
