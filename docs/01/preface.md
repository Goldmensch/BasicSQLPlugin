## Why

I have worked with databases for some years now. I made a lot of mistakes and a lot of dumb decisions in the past.
Most probably just because no one told me that I was doing it wrong. To spare you a lot of time and prevent you from making the same mistakes I created this page.

## Minecraft relation

Since the most Java developers today can be found in the Minecraft programming community the examples on this page will sometimes have a relation to Minecraft topics. I also encountered the most flawed code examples for databases in this community in the past. However the examples and advices given in this repository can be generally applied to all applications with a database connection.
